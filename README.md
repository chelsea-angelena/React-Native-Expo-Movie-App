  <p>This is a movie search app that has been built using react-native/expo, firebase, node.js/express.js, and the open movie database. User authentiation is provided by firebase, and the open movie database is connected to the front end react-application through an express.js server. Firebase/Firestore keeps all of the logged in users saved movies in a database so they can add, delete, and update their saved movies at any time.</p>

  <p> Built using react hooks and functional components</p>

<p>To clone and use locally you will need to create a firebase project and firebase config file. If you need any help please send me a message :) </p>

<p>Check out the project here:</p>

<p>Either scan the QR code (expo-app is required to scan the code, but it's free!) or, click "view in browser", this launches an android emulator. </p>
