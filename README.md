  <p>This is a movie search app that has been built using react-native/expo, firebase, node.js/express.js, and the open movie database. Google Sign in has been implemented for fast and secure user log in, and the open movie database is connects the front end react-application through an express.js server. Firebase/Firestore keeps all of the logged in users saved movies in a database so they can add, delete, and update their saved movies at any time.</p>

  <p> Built using react hooks and functional components</p>

<p>To clone and use locally you will need to create a firebase project and firebase config file and set up environment variables. If you need any help please send me a message :) </p>

<p>Check out the project here:</p>
